# Very little migration, both directions seem to start, but doesn't carry on. 
# From earlier analysis:
# First localizaton on the left side (t8), then on the right (t13). Left is abandoned by t16. First source on the right (t19), at t26 this side is abandoned. t28, source on left side. Stab t34, t46 oceanization.
